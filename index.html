  <p><h3 align="Center">Interest in IT</h3></p>
  <p>I was raised around computers. Even at a young age, I was typing away at the old family Mac OS X.</p>
  <p>I've always had an affinity for clear actions having clear results, and computers are the incarnation of that.</p>
  <p>As a result of that affinity, most things I know within information technology, I taught myself. Trial and error.</p>
  <p>Of course, no knowledge exists in a vacuum, and I've had questions before. I look things up, I ask questions, and when those resources ran out, I turned to the university that I was told had the best student experience.</p>
I'm hoping to learn things that I couldn't before, about computers and technology, the behind-the-scenes stuff that never comes up as an end-user under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>This is a retail management position, wherein one is in charge of a Kathmandu store selling camping and other outdoor survival equipment. This resembles my ideal job of owning my own store, as it covers most of the same day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>This position requires strong resource and time management skills, as well as a cool head under pressure and an understanding of the principles of customer service. A retail manager must balance their time and effort with the standards of practice and the bottom line of the business. In addition, a hiring owner would appreciate any managerial experience, as well as a tertiary qualification in management, as assurance of their competence.</p>
<a title="If I already had all the skills necessary to get my job, but not the opportunity or resources, the plan to get them is somewhat irrelevant. This question has several assumptions about socioeconomic and cultural norms that I do not agree with.

<p>Why is an IT course making economic, sociological, and cultural commentary?">Currently, I lack any relevant certification.</p></a>
<a title="The whole reason I want my own business is to circumvent the need to meet arbitrary and irrelevant standards of someone else only to be passed up for their son-in-law, as has happened to me, personally, at least once.">My current plan for obtaining the necessary requirements for my ideal job is to obtain enough starting capital to start my own business. I have the abilities and skills, and need only the opportunity.</a></td>

It has been debunked an unrealistic amount of times by real scientists. That it ever got use as a supposedly legitimate tool for assessment of anything is mind-boggling, let alone its persistence in anyone's modern-day toolset.">Myers-Briggs</a>, administered by <a title="My god, the survey webpage even sounds like a facebook survey.

  My Myers-Briggs results (as on 12/09/2020):<br>
  INFJ-A, "Advocate"<br>
  54% Introverted - 46% Extroverted<br>
  59% Intuitive - 41% Sense<br>
  63% Feeling - 37% Thinking<br>
  63% Judging - 37% Perceiving<br>
  63% Assertive - 37% Turbulent<br>
  </p>
  <p>The Myers-Briggs test, in any of its incarnations, does not have any meaning (Thompson & Borrello 1986). It informs nobody of anything, least of all employability. The influence of these test results on my team-based behaviour is to discourage me from respecting anyone who takes these results into account, and therefore to avoid forming teams with those people.</p>

  <p><em>Learning Style, administered by www.studyingstyle.com</em></p>
  <p>My learning style results (as on 15/09/2020):<br>
  2 Visual<br>
  5 Auditory<br>
  8 Tactile/Kinesthetic<br></p>
  <p>A learning style changes the way a person interacts with their environment, especially new ones. These test results do not accurately reflect this, as this is necessarily oversimplified and likely inaccurate as a result of being administered by a website, rather than under controlled conditions. If this were an accurate reading, it would mean taking more hands-on roles within a team, and helping people through tasks instead of explaining them. It would encourage me to form teams with those who had complementary styles.</p>

  <p>My Hogwarts House (as on 16/09/2020):<br>
  Ravenclaw</p>
  <p>Ravenclaw is the house of wit, wisdom, and learning. This would make me useful to adapt to the technical aspect of a group project, able to offer insights and intelligence. A proper team formed with this information would either be comprised of balanced views from the other houses or complementary members from Ravenclaw, to better improve our collective aptitude at a given technical task.</p>

  <p><h3>Project Plan</h3></p>
  <a title="I took much less time to describe the project than the wordcount suggested. So I padded a little in the next few sections."><p>This project plan is to create a small utility tool for converting iPhone contacts, message history, and other assorted information, as .ddb, .html, and other files, to the compatible Android files (Anon. 2020).</p></a>
  <p>As Android’s market share increases (‘Android POS Market 2018 Global Share,Trend,Segmentation and Forecast to 2023’ 2018), more people need to transfer from Apple operating systems. After transferring from an old iPhone, one finds that a simple transfer of pertinent operational files isn’t possible, especially without either an Apple account or Google account, and subsequently agreeing to both terms of service. Once a tool for extracting the raw data from an Apple proprietary backup is found, one finds that it’s not stored in the same way as Android data. An additional tool is required.</p>
  <p>This will be a small utilitarian script which could take the raw contact, messages, notes, call history, photos, videos, and calendar entries from the proprietary Apple app formats. Said data would be extracted from backups.</p>
  <p>The current plan is to use the formats outputted by iMyFone® iTransor Lite, a data exporter available free online. It outputs most of the data in a mostly human readable format, that of tables on html files. From there, it is a simple matter of understanding how to write Android files, how to scrape from the html, and to write a tool which does both.</p>
  <p>However, contacts in particular are in a different file format of unknown encryption, which is not human readable. The extension is .ddb. Once that file type is understood, extracting from the data and writing to the Android format should be as simple as the other types.</p>
  <p>The intended UI is for a simple dialogue box allowing for entries of filepaths for folders containing the data as outputted by the iMyFone® iTransor tool, as well as the intended destination folder. Then, once run, the tool would save Android files containing all converted data from the target folder to the destination folder. Existing files would trigger a prompt asking for confirmation, and if given, those files would be overwritten with the new files.</p>
  <p>The user would then be able to install the Android files manually.</p>
  <p><a title="For the Tools and Technologies, the padding went over the wordcount a little. I'm given to understand that that's not a deal breaker.">This tool would depend on iMyFone® technology, or something equivalent, to extract data from Apple backups. This is currently available at </a><a title="For the Tools and Technologies, the padding went over the wordcount a little. I'm given to understand that that's not a deal breaker." href="https://www.imyfone.com/">https://www.imyfone.com/</a><a title="For the Tools and Technologies, the padding went over the wordcount a little. I'm given to understand that that's not a deal breaker.">, and is currently compatible with iOS versions up to iOS 13. In addition, it requires backups to be made of the iPhone data, which in turn requires iTunes, and a functioning computer, preferably Mac but Windows versions of iTunes are available.</a></p>
  <p>There is a use of iMyFone® iTransor Lite that exports directly from an iPhone, but for the purposes of this project we will not be using it. One can also obtain backups from iCloud, but this is redundant for the purposes of this project.</p>
  <p>To complete this project one needs a grasp of a given programming language, and the knowledge of how to scrape data from html documents. Furthermore, an understanding of the data output into a .ddb file by the iMyFone® iTransor Lite tool is essential to completion of this project.</p>
  <p><a title="I intentionally broke formality rules for the Outcome section of the project plan, intending to inject levity into it. It's also brief. For this segment I expect to lose points.">Once completed, this tool will allow me to finally get my old contacts onto my new phone. If public, it can allow others the same joy.</a></p>
